# SpriteCloudRepo
This is the repo where the SpriteCloud test assessments will be stored.

1. Install Eclipse - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Pull the repo from GitHub
3. Download Chrome WebDriver - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
4. Download Selenium WebDriver - https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
5. Import the project in Eclipse and add the .jar (Selenium WebDriver and Chrome Driver) files on the Build Path under the Class Module.
6. I chose these 3 sceanrios as they have varied element identifiers.
7. I struggled with the test results and could not get them to run, I removed the code from the repo.
8. I would improve to generate a actual test report.
